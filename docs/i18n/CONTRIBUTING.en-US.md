# Contributing to Astral Platform & HCI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Astral Platform & HCI! This
document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

This project and all participants are governed by the
[Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected
to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the existing issues as you might find
out that you don't need to create one. When creating a bug report, please
include as many details as possible:

* A clear and descriptive title
* The exact steps which reproduce the problem
* The behavior you observed after following the steps
* The behavior you expected to see instead
* Screenshots, if applicable
* Your environment (distribution and version, Java, Node, browser, etc.)

> 💡 This project controls networking, firewall and identity. When reporting a
> firewall or DNS bug, always include the `diff` Astral produced between desired
> and observed state. It is the most valuable information available here.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating one,
please include:

* A clear and descriptive title
* A detailed description of the proposed enhancement
* Any relevant examples
* The motivation for the enhancement

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs or contracts, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing code style.
6. Create a pull request with a clear title and description.

## ⚠️ Non-negotiable rules

These three rules come from architecture decisions already made. A PR that
violates them will be rejected, even if the code is correct.

### 1. The installer never writes source code

`scripts/install-astral.sh` is the **only** installer. It is pure bash and
**never** generates `pom.xml` or any `.java` file.

> **Why:** an installer that writes the code it compiles overwrites working code
> with dead code. Generated code goes into the repository and goes through
> review.

If your PR needs to generate code, the generated code goes into the repository.

### 2. `ddl-auto` is `validate`, and Flyway does the migrating

Do not add `@Entity` without an explicit migration in
`src/main/resources/db/migration/`.

> **Why:** `validate` makes startup **fail** when the database does not match the
> Java, instead of pretending all is well. And the legacy `fabric/firewall/`
> app (8040) is **retired but still in the repository** — and
> `InstallerFirewall.java` still deploys it —, which is one of the two things
> the migration into `src/main/java/com/astral/fabric/` has to end.

### 3. Session in the UI, and the ATS Bearer off by default

The session is stateful, server-side, with an `HttpOnly` cookie. Do not
introduce token-based authentication in the panel without first discussing the
model change — ATS and Nginx depend on the trusted proxy header.

There is one exception: `GET /api/v1/acl/check` **accepts** a Bearer HS256 JWT,
and it is **off by default** (`ASTRAL_AUTH_JWT_ENABLED=false`). The BrasilCloud
Auth Service does not issue tokens yet, and validating a JWT that nobody issues
is work for nothing. If you are going to turn it on, read the
[integration guide](../../docs/GUIA-INTEGRACAO-AUTH-SERVICE.md) first —
especially section 28, on what issuance will require.

## 🛠 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* Java 21 (Oracle JDK or OpenJDK/Temurin)
* Maven 3.9+
* Node.js 20+
* PostgreSQL 15+
* Python 3.10+ (for the `fabric/` scripts)

### Building

```bash
# Backend
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Infrastructure
sudo ./installbase.sh

# Application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Verifying the installation

```bash
./scripts/verify-astral.sh
```

```

## Coding Standards

* Follow the existing code style (Spring Boot 3.3.5 / Java 21, Python, React).
* Use meaningful variable and method names.
* Write clear commit messages, in Portuguese, in the conventional format
  (`type(scope): description`).
* Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility.
* **Comment over dead code.** This project has many comments explaining *why*
  something is the way it is. Preserve that standard.
